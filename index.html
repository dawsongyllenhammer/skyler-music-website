    <div class="aboutme">
        <p>Hello! My name is Skyler Hughett, and within this wonderful world of music I am predominantly an instructor, a guitarist, and a vocalist. I am currently a third-year college student studying for a music degree at Cabrillo college, with plans to transfer to UCSC in 2022. 
            <br><br>
            When it comes to industry experience, I’ve worked on countless high-end corporate gigs and wedding events doing audio tech and light work for the company “Sound and Motion.”
            <br><br>
            When it comes to performances and experience on stage, I have performed as lead vocalist and lead guitarist for a variety of pop & rock bands. I’ve also sung and performed in several choral groups, as well as participated in a variety of classical and jazz ensembles through the Cabrillo College music department.
            <br><br>
            As a result of my experience, I am adept in a variety of styles, such as rock/pop, jazz, and to a lesser extent classical. I’ve always taken pride in the dynamic range of genres I can perform. I have a strong interest in the technical skill and craft of guitar playing, so in my teaching rhetoric I stand by the importance of foundational skills within the complex world of music theory.
            <br><br>
            If you are considering hiring me for a solo guitar gig, booking my band for a live show, or taking <a href="lessons.html">guitar lessons</a> from me, you can contact me at <a href="mailto:skylerhughett1@gmail.com">skylerhughett1@gmail.com</a>.
